# hello-world
My first repository in GitHub.

Greetings,

Welcome to my GitHub world. I am a senior IT consultant with more 15 years of extensive experience in IT field. Below is a list of my interests:
- Programming, this is my job, the technologies and/or tools I usually use are following:
  - Windows applications development with Delphi, .NET, PL/SQL, JavaScript, Java, etc.
  - Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, etc.
- Hobbies
  Basketball, Soccer, Camping, etc.
  
It's sad that I don't even use GitHub for so many years working as an IT guy. Today I decided to make some changes, to start a new thing.
Then I am here.


Cheers,
